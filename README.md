# datatracking
I am going to track data about my life for a week and try to represent it in a few different ways.

#What data?

###Fitness
I plan to collect steps, sleep time, deep sleep time, distance travelled, distance ran and heart rate.

###Technology
I plan to see what BASH commands I use, how much 3G data I use and my phone screen on time.



#How?

###Fitness
Using a Mi Band, Bryton watch and Bryton Heart rate monitor.

###Technology
Using [this script](https://gist.github.com/francislewis/b8a7aba57fa40234a5df) and the stock andriod settings app (Using a Nexus 4 on andriod 5.1).
